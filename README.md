# CS354
Course materials for CS-354 (Machine Organization and Programming), taken at UW - Madison. Course material is analogous to 15-213 ICS (Intro to Computing Systems) at Carnegie Mellon University.

This repository includes all my thoroughly detailed lecture notes currently. Tenatively, if it becomes appropiate to post projects and homework assingments (ie. if UW - Madison changes the projects in the near future) then those will be included in this repositiory as well.

Other common names for this course material: Computer Systems, Computer Archtiecture, Computer Organization
